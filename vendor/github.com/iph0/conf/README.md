Package conf is an extensible solution for cascading configuration. Package conf
provides configuration processor that can load configuration layers from
different sources and merges them into the one configuration tree. In addition
configuration processor can expand variables in string values and process _var
and _include directives in resulting configuration tree. Package conf comes with
built-in configuration loaders: fileconf and envconf, and can be extended by
third-party configuration loaders. Package conf do not watch for configuration
changes, but you can implement this feature in the custom configuration loader.
You can find full example in repository.
